# Tesselate_based_formation_strategy_for_a_swarm of robots
This paper introduces a novel control technique for a swarm of robots transporting one or more almost flat objects to a desired goal through an unknown environment. The proposed approach has three distinct parts. The first part of our work is about identifying the spatial property of the objects in the loading stations sequentially. The second part introduces a tessellation-based control strategy enforcing the agents to acquire the desired formation for every newly loaded object. In the final part, the swarm is required to carry the objects sequentially between the loading stations and finally to the desired destination in a fully decentralized way. The simulation result and the comparison study demonstrate our proposed approach's effectiveness for real-time object transport using swarms.
